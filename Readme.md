# Fixtures

  Tests with fixtures data as JSON.
  

## Installation

Install via npm:

    $ npm install fixtures

## Usage

The project will look for a directory named  `fixtures` which must be child of your `test` directory in order to load all the fixtures:

test\fixtures\users.js

```js
  {
    "my_own_user": {
      "name": "Charles",
      "type": "M"
    },
    "female": {
      "name": "Susana",
      "type": "F"
    }
  }
```

Access fixtures depending on the name you gave to your fixtures files.
 
```js

  fx = require('fixtures');

  fx.users.my_own_user.name; ("Charles")

```

Reload the fixtures on either setup or teardown when the fixtures were modified on tests
 
```js

  fx.reload();

```
